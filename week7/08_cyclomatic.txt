Work Plan
Select a method, function or procedure from your project. Make sure no other team member selects the same method. You may reuse any other method you may have selected for Black Box testing.
Derive the flow graph and calculate the cyclomatic complexity.
Share your calculations with the rest of the team to verify that they are correct.
Write a new class with as many test cases as the cyclomatic complexity.
The class performing the test needs to have detailed documentation on how the cyclomatic complexity was obtained.
Write the required stubs in additional classes if needed so that the test is self-contained (runs simply by compiling and executing a single class file).
The test should explicitly report their outcome by returning a Boolean result.



Assessment
Include all the information derived from this exercise in a folder with name 08_cyclomatic.

Full mark is obtained if:

The calculation of the cyclomatic complexity is correctly explained.
There are the right number of tests.
The tests are written correctly.
The tests report their outcome by returning a Boolean result.
