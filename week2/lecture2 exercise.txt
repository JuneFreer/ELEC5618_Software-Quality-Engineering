design review:
inspect the design diagram for system arithecture, detail design of each function of system,
evalute the hardware resource required, suggest any changes if needed

preliminary design review: gives an idea to the users of what the system would look like, meet the requirement.

critical design review: check technical design (how the system would work, giving the pictures for developer)

program design review: conduct with developer to get feedback before implementation
security design review

code inspection:
pair of people, define roles of people
focus, finding bugs and performance, maintainability,memory leak(memory management)
deliver feedback to author
author should comfirm
changes merge into a branch
frequncy depends on the cases of developing things(featue)
follow up the reiew schedule, set deadline

defect reduction:
daliy regression test
unit test throughout the development(exposing the bugs by runing the test---prevention, or passing the testsuit by fixing the tested codes---reduction)
store test data and analysis and result
system test for logically implementation errors
keeping the history of code
bug assignment, find someone fix
document the changes

defect containment
automated downgrade system or software
stop transcation
rollback to previous working version
give a payback
error control traffic
