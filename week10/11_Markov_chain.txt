Work Plan
Select the functionality of your product for which you wrote a FSM for testing.
Choose one of the two:
Modify the code in your product so that it writes logs with the events that are executed. Run the product and store those logs.
Create a file with fictitious events extracted from the execution of your product.
Document the structure of such file.
Adapt the FSM that you created so that it is capable of interpreting these events in the file.

The file with platform logs and a description of such format.


Create a script or a program in your favourite programming language that receives a unique parameter (the file name with the logs of your product) and prints in the output the set of probabilities for the transition between states. The following steps are recommended:

Parse all the events in the file.
Collect the name of all the states that are traversed.
If the logs contain information about the user executing the product, repeat the following step for each user.
For every log line, read the state of the following event and keep a count of the transitions for every pair of states.
For every state, collect all possible transitions, count the number of times the transitions appear and divide by the total (from the state). Print those numbers as probabilities.

Assessment

The test description resulting from the activity needs to be submitted for assessment in a folder with name 11_Markov_chain. Full mark is obtained if:

The procedure to obtain the probabilities is clearly documented in the code.
The script to process the text file works and produces the correct probability values.
