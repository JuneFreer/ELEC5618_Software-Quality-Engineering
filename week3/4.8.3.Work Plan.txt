2. Quality is achieved in certain part by reviewing the multiple steps during the development process. Describe what do you need to deploy, how would you implement, and what are the objectives of the following procedures: design review, code inspection.





3. Software has to be tested. But the testing can be done at various levels. Provide a definition of three levels of testing and the type of procedures included in each of them. Give examples related to your project.
