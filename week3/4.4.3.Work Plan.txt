1. What is the purpose of the IEEE 730-2002 standard?
	
	It is to provide uniform ,minimum accepatable requirements for preparation and 	content of SQAP.
	detail how to prepare SQAP including any type of information would be needed.
	It lists the name(s) of the software items covered by the SQAP and the intended use of the software. 
	It states the portion of the software life cycle covered by the SQAP for each software item specified.
	(SQAP--Software quality assurance plan)

2. Choose one of the documents suggested by IEEE 730-2002 and describe its content

	Software Design Description(SDD): A description in blocks of the intended implementation to comply with the software requirements, describe the components and subcomponents of the software design, including database and interal interface,
	should be expanded in details afterwards for facilitying the implementation.
	Its content may contain the followings:
	a. identification--- Date of issue and status, scope of software, Issuing organisation, responsibility or copyright information, References and Context
	b. identify the design stakeholders for the design subject
	c. identify the design concerns of each identified design stakeholder
	d. address each identified design concern
	e. organised into design views--- contain design elements, and different design concerns(functionality,reliability,performance and maintainability)
	f. design viewpoint--- functional views of system(such as functions, input/output),and also should select design languages for viewpoint specification.
	e. design overlays--- to represent additional information which only relevant to one design viewpoint.
	g. design rationale--- lists the reasons of designing the system and how to make those design decisions, includes any
	design issues and options being considered.

3. Choose on of the "review processes" described in the IEEE 730-2002 that you think applies to your product and describe its details

	Detail Design Review(DDR): determine the acceptability of the detail software designs as depicted in the detailed
	software design description in satisfying the requirements of the software requirements description.
	a. 2-3 hour block schedule and invite participants including some product field experts
	b. have the requirements specification ready
	c. evaluate designed functions and others supporting functions, see whether produce the desired effects
	d. evaluate any changes in the architecture of system, spot any issues might affect the operations of system
	e. take account the security issues, analysis the factors might affect
	f. evaluate the standard tolerances of the tests

3. Write five features in your product that are related to any of the following aspects of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard: time behavior, resource utilization, interoperability, learnability, user error protection, fault tolerance, maintainability.

	learnability: people can learn the basic skills for handling chrome in short time, from online document in the help features
	time-behavior: reaction time of loading pages normally less than hundreds of ms
	interoperability: run on almost os platform, by using google account in the chrome, could store the data in the cloud,
	also exporting bookmarks can import into some other supporting browser, extension of chrome enable the possiblities of
	exchanging information to other systems by external developed features.
	fault tolerance: previous pages could reopen after crushes 
	maintainability: the system modularized, such as plugin,ui,messages subsystem, extension, security
