Review IEEE 730-2002 and its most important parts. What is the purpose of such document? Why is it useful? Which role do you see it playing when a company provides software to be used within another product (a library, for example)?

Purpose

a) Identify the documentation governing the development, verification and validation, use, and maintenance of the software.
b) List which documents are to be reviewed or audited for adequacy. For each document listed, identify
the reviews or audits to be conducted and the criteria by which adequacy is to be confirmed, with reference to reviewing section of 
the software quality assurance plan

It maintains the adequate documents to allow further maintaining. For using a library in another product, user documentation
can provide the usage of the library, and also design descriptions describe the crucial blocks of it, developers could
understand the library without looking the whole block of codes. Documentation acts as a media for dilivering enough information
to relevant people at any time they want.
