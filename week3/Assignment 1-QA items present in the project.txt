a document containing a list with three product functionalities, a figure with the architecture, and list with the most important data structures


1. A list (not longer than 1 page) with three product functionalities described from the point of view of the user. Try to avoid the most obvious ones. Each functionality should be described unambiguously.
(The three functionalities are clearly described from what the user does with the product)

1.	Print a plan and 3D rendering
2.	Modifying specific model properties
3.	Creating a 3D image, complete with models chosen by the user, based off an architectural floor plan





2. A figure illustrating the main architectural blocks of the project (code blocks, modules, data structures, functions, etc.) The figure should convey as much information as possible without providing implementation details.
(The figure contains the main blocks of the product (not more than 10) and the relations among them in terms of functionality)





A list with the most important data structures
(The list contains the most important data structures of the product (not more than 10) and their relationship)
