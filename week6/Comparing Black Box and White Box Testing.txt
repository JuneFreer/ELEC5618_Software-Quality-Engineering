black box testing (BBT) and white box testing (WBT)

1. What type of code portions are more likely tested by each method
	WBT would be focus on testing the all the program block as much as possible, and data structures inside the system.
	BBT would be cover attributes of system, including Correctness, Usability, Performance etc.
it is to perform over the entire system, ensure the behaviour of system meet the system specification.

2. When is each method more used during the development time of a product (earlier vs later)
	WBT is more likely to be used during the earlier implementation of features, to ensure the proper function of each single block of codes.
	BBT is more used during the later stage system test and integration test, which involves the interaction with interface
from other modules.

3. What type of defects to they focus on
	WBT would focus on any deep logically and branch bugs, and language errors.
	BBT would focus on defects or facults of the system, such as improper function, ui error and any performance issues.

4. Which of these methods detects defects that are easier to fix
	The defects detected from WBT would be much easier to fix, because it is mainly in the small block of the system with 
less interfering with other blocks, and also the inputs of test cases are simple, makes origin of those defects be easier 
to track down.	
	The defects from BBT are for entire system, usually involve interactions with other modules or dependency systems,
the inputs of test cases are more complicated and hard to find out the source of errors.

5. What type of individual is more likely to perform each of the tests
	WBT is usually done by people have implementation knowledge of certain features of the system.
	BBT is usually carried out by test engineers or with knowing the entire specifications of the system, and people
intend to use the interface of the target system or modules, do not need to know the implementation detail.
