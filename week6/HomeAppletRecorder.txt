writeHome method should surround the close action of
'OutputStream out = connection.getOutputStream();' 
'InputStream in = connection.getInputStream();'	
with try catch finally block, ensure the in out resource release even after throw exceptions.


getHomeLength should release LengthOutputStream and DefaultHomeOutputStream afterwards.
